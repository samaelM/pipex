# Pipex

Hey!! this is my version of the project pipex from school 42.

## How to install

you first need to download this repo :

```bash
gcl https://github.com/samaelM/pipex
```

## ENJOY!

create the executable with :

```bash
make
```

execute like this :

```bash
./pipe [infile] [cmd1] [cmd2] [outfile]
```

this should recreate the function of bash pipe | more exactly it recreates this setup

```bash
< infile ls -l | wc -l > outfile
```
